**Intro**

## üß≠ Intro

This project is a responsive website prototype designed using Figma, with careful attention to layout adaptability across a range of screen sizes‚Äîfrom mobile to desktop. The goal is to ensure consistent user experience and visual integrity regardless of the device.

Key objectives of this project include:

- Practicing fluid and flexible UI design in Figma
- Applying breakpoint strategies for different screen widths
- Enhancing understanding of visual hierarchy and spacing in responsive layouts

Whether you're prototyping a product landing page or refining a portfolio layout, this exercise serves as a practical deep-dive into the foundations of modern web responsiveness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using foundational front-end technologies that form the core of modern web development:

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the web pages, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling and layout, with a strong focus on responsive design principles including media queries, flexbox, and grid systems.

By leveraging these technologies, the project achieves consistent visual presentation across multiple devices and screen sizes, while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
